# Lessons Learned — Verification 2026-02-10

## 1. English draughts vs International draughts
- **Backward pawn capture**: In English draughts, pawns can ONLY jump forward. Backward jumps are a rule of International draughts (10×10 board). The code had a comment incorrectly claiming backward jumps are allowed in English draughts.
- **Promotion during jump**: In English draughts, when a pawn reaches the crown row during a multi-jump, it is promoted AND the turn ends immediately. No further jumps are allowed in that turn. This differs from some other variants.

## 2. Code-report synchronization
- Heuristic code had 5 components (~3000 points of scoring impact) that were completely undocumented in the formal equations. This created a false impression that only 7 components existed.
- Safety zone defined differently in code (rectangular area) vs equations (exact fields). Always define game constants as exact field sets, not geometric approximations.

## 3. Context-dependent bug impact
- Both engine bugs are irrelevant for king-only endgames (the specific test scenario), but would produce illegal moves in midgame positions with pawns. Always verify the scope of bugs before panicking.

## 4. Julia syntax
- `const` cannot be used inside functions in Julia. Use regular variables or define constants at module scope.

## 5. Value Function Tuning via Ablation
- **Surprising discoveries**: Ablation studies are crucial. We found that the complex "Net Formation" heuristic, designed for 2v1 endgames, was actually causing the AI to draw (by preventing simple direct attacks) instead of winning. Removing it led to a win in 9 moves.
- **Component interaction**: Individual components might be "logical" in isolation but counter-productive when combined with others (e.g., Cornering vs Net).
- **Pruning savings**: Simple "LossOfPiece" pruning (pseudo-terminal state) saved ~9% of search nodes without affecting decision quality (Baseline vs Pruning_None).

## 6. Simulation Scripting
- **Global scope in `include()`**: When including a script that uses global variables (like `tree_enabled` in `testvaluefunc.jl`), setting them in a local scope (inside a function in another script) defines a *new local* variable, shadowing the global one. Always use `global variable = value` to modify the included script's state.

## 7. Diagnosis of "Optimal" Strategy Failure
- **Looping vs Winning**: The baseline strategy (with Net Formation) was superior in static evaluation but failed in practice because it created a "local optimum" trap. The AI preferred to oscillate between two high-scoring states rather than make a "lower scoring" move required to progress the game.
- **Repetition Detection**: The original simulation (`run_assignment_simulation`) masked this by detecting the 3-fold repetition and declaring a Draw. The initial ablation script lacked this check, running until the move limit.
- **Fix**: Disabling the component that caused the high-score trap (`No_Net`) allowed the AI to find the true winning path. This highlights the danger of over-engineered heuristics without dynamic verification.
